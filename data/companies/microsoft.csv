Dec 18, 2014,Software Development Engineering,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,-,I visited their booth at my University's career fair and then got an on-campus interview about 1 and a half months later. The on-campus interview was a short 30 minute interview where I got asked questions about linked lists: How would you determine if there is a cycle in a linked list? How would you find the head of the cycle i.e. where the cycle starts? How would you find the kth element from the end of a linked list? Then about 2 weeks later I got an invitation for interviews on-site and about 3 weeks after that I flew out to Redmond. I had 4 interviews on-site which had behavioral questions and also coding questions like: How would you test a phone (your simple 20 year old phone)? Give test cases for some functions whose implementation is not know i.e. blackbox testing. The people there were great and I really liked their campus.,Mar 3, 2017,Software Development Engineer,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,-,I was messaged by Microsoft recruiters from Linkedin. They sent me an online assesment which you have to complete in 60 minutes. If you pass that you will be able to go on-site. I interviewed at Microsoft on campus in Redmond for a full day loop of 6 people. Everyone was super friendly and super excited about future of Microsoft under new CEO leadership.,Feb 9, 2017,Software Development Engineer,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,-,I applied and got an on-campus interview because of a connection with Campus Recruitment.The interview was quick, with a coding question, some resume review, and a question about explaining and making a simple diagram of a previous project. Not a very personal experience, and I likely did not stand out enough as a confident candidate.,Feb 2, 2017,Software Development Engineer,Accepted Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,-,Had a referral sent in by a friend and had a phone screen with the manager (mostly questions about the team and my past experience, followed by a quick coding question). Followed by about a month of inactivity and then was brought in to an onsite with 4 people (3 engineers, 1 manager) and a lunch at the cafeteria. Each round involved talking about personal projects and experience, followed by a technical question and a demo of the team's product in several cases. Surprised by a 5th interviewer pop up at the end who seemed unaware of me and was on his phone and walked off in the middle to get tea. Maybe this was a test to see how I would respond? Was called a couple days later with a negotiable offer, only minor problems with difficulty getting hold of the recruiter.,Jan 28, 2017,Software Development Engineer,Accepted Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,-,5 algorithmic questions got asked over and over different data structures and algorithm questions. It was difficult compared to modern hiring practices. Totally different once I joined the team. Worse thing is that the lunch interview is still an interview so watch out.,Jan 30, 2017,Software Development Engineer,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,-,First round - on campus 45 minutes coding round. Flew to Seattle. Total 4 rounds in person. Three coding rounds and one behavioral + previous work experience + projects + background. All coding rounds are whiteboard coding.,May 8, 2017,Software Development Engineer,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,-,On campus interview. The interviewer asked some basic list reversal questions, didn't even look up at the board for my answers. Spent the whole interview checking email. Felt like he thought he had better things to do.,May 26, 2017,Software Development Engineer,Declined Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,-,The interview process for Microsoft was pretty standard. I got in through the college career fair, so they had one technical interview in person at the college campus and then 4 rounds of technical interviews at Redmond. The provided with really good accommodation for the onsite interviews and also provided with a discount voucher for the Microsoft Store.,May 23, 2017,Software Development Engineer,Declined Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,-,The recruiter sent me an invitation for an on-campus technical interview. I was asked to schedule the onsite the next day. I asked for three weeks to prepare. The onsite process is pretty standard as many other companies. I had four interviews all of them with senior developers/managers in the respective teams. I was asked questions related to DP and Backtracking. CTCI along with decent practice from Leetcode is enough to crack the interview. We need to be careful testing the code we write.,
